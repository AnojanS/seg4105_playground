A functionality that does not exist in Brightspace that I would appreciate is the ability to control notifications. Notifications currently are created for every event but users should have the ability to choose what specifically they recieve notifications for in every one of their classes.

To address this issue, a Settings tab could be added to the header bar of every class' Brightspace site which provides a list of topics users can check to recieve notifcations for. This way students would only receive notifications for events important to them and not worry about missing them in a storm of other notifications of lesser importance.
